                    Hello, my name is <strong>Sandhya Harshakumar,</strong> and i'm an aspiring Full-stack Engineer. Originally from Kerala state in India, i moved to UK around 16 years back with my husband and son on an HSMP visa( currently a British citizen). I'm a passionate tutor too and have always tried to motivate younger girls into STEM and Technology. During my free-time i volunteer to support my friends' children in core STEM subjects. I'm a highly motivated, self-learner and a friendly individual. I believe this is the perfect time to also focus on myself and do what i have always aspired to. I have put my learning into practice by doing some exciting projects. Please check my <a href = "https://github.com/Sandhya80?tab=repositories">Github</a> and <a href = "projects.html">Projects</a> page on this website to find the different projects i've been working on.<br>
